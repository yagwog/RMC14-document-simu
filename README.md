that's a lie actually, much help from the RMC community help me make this
I will eventually write a guide how to clone the repo, and set the template destination to another repo if you wish to use it for another ss14 servers paperwork

**please please please PLEASE report any issues on git, I'm only human and make mistakes, people pointing out issues or even doing PR's to help me will extremely help me getting this to a perfect 1-2-1 and improve the QOS of the webapp**
