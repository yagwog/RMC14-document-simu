**Webapp: https://yagwog.github.io/RMC14-document-simu/**

Much love to the RMC14 community helped me make this
I will eventually write a guide how to clone the repo, and set the template destination to another repo if you wish to use it for another ss14 servers paperwork

**please please please PLEASE report any issues on git, I'm only human and make mistakes, people pointing out issues or even doing PR's to will help me (or even help yourself) get this to a perfect 1-2-1 of ss14 paperwork and improve the QOS of the webapp**
